## Hi there! I am Igor Ruiz! 😁

Tech Student at São Paulo Faculty of Technology and IT Intern at Ball Corporation.

I am building my IT trajectory currently in the Data Bases major where we focus on software development with Java, Database programing and administration, software engineering, Data WareHouse projects, Database architecture and modeling and Database optmization.
